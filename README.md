## Overview

This project was to re-create an OS of our choosing.
I based this off of Windows 11 darkmode style that I displayed on my laptop and tried to match.

### Goals

The goal of this was to better implement our understanding of html, scss, and js, including using more arrow functions, modals and other js implementations.
